We’ve created the following 5 financial guarantees* for those who sign up to our Silver and Gold Management Packages, to help reduce the financial risk you face as a landlord and to prove that having spent more than 25 years managing rental property, we know what we’re doing.
Please note Our Financial Guarantees do not apply to Waiheke Island properties.
<br>
<br>
1. If your tenant won’t pay the rent – we will.
That’s right. We know what it takes to collect your rent, on time, every time. So, under our Gold & Silver packages, if for any reason your tenant doesn’t pay the rent, we will. If you’re carrying a reasonably sized mortgage, or are reliant on your rental income to live this is one rental risk you can do without. And now you can.
<br>
<br>
2. If you’re still without a tenant after 28 days – we’ll pay the rent.
We’ve got access to a lot of great tenants and we’re really good at attracting new ones, so we’re extremely confident we’ll get you a great tenant – and yes, that’s a great tenant, not just anyone (that’s way too risky!). So, just in case we should take longer than expected, we’ve got you covered; if you don’t have a tenant after 28 days with us, we’ll pay the rent until you do. Simple.
<br>
<br>
3. Not happy – don’t pay us.
We pride ourselves on delivering a great service to our clients. So if you’re disappointed for any reason, let us know and we’ll be sure to rectify it. And if we can’t rectify a problem? We’ll refund your last month’s management fee. Now that is good service.
<br>
<br>
4. Three months – risk free (of course).
If you really want to know how good we are at property management, there’s an easy way to find out. Put us to the test. All we ask for is three months and we know you’ll be hooked. But just in case you aren’t, we’ll deliver your file to anyone you choose within 24 hours, at no cost to you.
<br>
<br>
5. Switch to us – no cost, no stress.
If you’re not happy with the service or support you’re getting from another property manager, we’ll make it easy to switch to Auckland Property Management. And to make sure it’s a stress free transition, we’ll take care of everything, contacting your existing property manager and making sure we’ve got all the records in your file provided. So you can relax, knowing you’re now in good hands.
